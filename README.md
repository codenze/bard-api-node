![Bard-API-Node](https://techviral.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Google-Rebrands-Its-AI-Chatbot-Bard-As-_Gemini_.png)
## Description
**bard-api-node** is a Node.js library for interacting with Bard, an AI Chatbot developed by Google. Bard is based on Google's Large language model (LLM), LaMDA, which is designed to generate human-like text and images in response to prompts. This updated version of the library is aligned with the launch of Gemini API, the successor to Bard, and integrates with the official Google API services.

## What is Bard (Gemini)?
Bard, now known as Gemini, is an AI Chatbot developed by Google, based on Googleâ€™s Large language model (LLM), LaMDA. Similar to how ChatGPT is based on GPT, Gemini utilizes neural networks to mimic the underlying architecture of the brain in the form of a computer. Gemini is conversational and allows users to write a prompt and receive human-like text and images generated by artificial intelligence.

## Installation

To use the Bard-API-Node library in your project, you can install it via npm directly:
```

```
or can install it via npm from Github:
```
npm install git+https://github.com/codenze/bard-api-node.git
```

javascript const { BardAPI } = require('bard-api-node');

async function testAssistant() {
  try { // Initialize BardAPI object const bard = new BardAPI();

  // Set API key
  const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY'; // Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with the obtained API key
  // Initialize chat with API key
  await bard.initilizeChat(apiKey);
  // Send a query to Bard
  const response = await bard.getBardResponse("Greetings! What can you do for me?");
  console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

testAssistant();
```
Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the actual API key obtained from Google AI Studio.

## Acknowledgements
This Node.js library for interacting with the Bard chat assistant is powered by the official Google AI Studio API and utilizes the `@google/generative-ai` npm library. The integration with Google's Gemini AI and the use of the `@google/generative-ai` library serve as the foundation for this implementation.

I extend my gratitude to the Google AI team for providing access to their advanced AI capabilities and for the comprehensive documentation that facilitated the development of this library.
